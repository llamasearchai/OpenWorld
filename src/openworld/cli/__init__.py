# This __init__.py can be kept simple.
# The main Typer app is usually defined in a main.py or cli.py inside this directory.
# The entry point in pyproject.toml will point to the Typer app object.

# Example: if you need to expose the app object for some reason (rarely needed for CLI structure itself)
# from .main import app_cli

# __all__ = ["app_cli"]
