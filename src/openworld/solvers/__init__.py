"""Numerical solvers for OpenWorld simulations."""

# This directory will house various numerical solvers, e.g.,
# - ODE solvers (RK4, Euler, etc.)
# - PDE solvers (FVM, FEM components)
# - Linear algebra solvers (sparse matrix utilities if not using scipy directly)
# - Optimization algorithms

# Example (if you were to add a specific solver module):
# from .ode_solvers import RK4Solver
# from .pde_solvers import FVMGrid
