"""Dashboard components for OpenWorld visualization."""

# This directory could house modules for creating interactive dashboards,
# possibly using frameworks like Streamlit, Dash, or Panel, integrated with Plotly plots.

# Example:
# from .battery_dashboard import create_battery_dashboard_layout
# from .main_dashboard_app import run_dashboard_app

__all__ = [
    # "create_battery_dashboard_layout",
