# Unit Tests for OpenWorld

This directory contains unit tests that verify the functionality of individual components (modules, classes, functions) of the OpenWorld system in isolation.

These tests are crucial for ensuring code correctness and for catching regressions early.

*Currently empty, will be populated with unit tests.*
