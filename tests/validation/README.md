# Validation Tests for OpenWorld

This directory contains validation tests. These tests are designed to verify the physical accuracy and correctness of the simulation outputs from OpenWorld against:

- Established benchmarks
- Analytical solutions
- Experimental data
- Known results from other validated simulation software

The goal is to ensure that OpenWorld's models and solvers produce scientifically valid results.

*Currently empty, will be populated with validation tests.*
