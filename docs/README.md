# OpenWorld Documentation

This directory contains the overall documentation for the OpenWorld project.

## Structure:

- `api/`: Detailed API reference, potentially auto-generated from docstrings.
- `modules/`: In-depth documentation for each core module (physics, battery, solar, agent, ai, etc.).
- `tutorials/`: Step-by-step tutorials and guides for using OpenWorld (can link to or include examples from `examples/notebooks`).
- `concepts/`: Explanations of core concepts, architecture, and design principles.
- `contributing.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
- `index.md` (or `index.rst`): The main landing page for the documentation.

*This is a placeholder structure. Actual documentation will be built out here using tools like Sphinx or MkDocs.*
