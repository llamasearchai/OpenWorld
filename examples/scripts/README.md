# Example Scripts for OpenWorld

This directory will contain Python scripts demonstrating how to use the OpenWorld library for various tasks, such as:

- Running simulations for different physics domains (general physics, battery, solar).
- Setting up and interacting with AI agents.
- Using the API client to communicate with an OpenWorld server.
- Performing data analysis and visualization on simulation results.

*Currently empty, will be populated with examples.*
