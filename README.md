## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get OpenWorld up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   Pip (Python package installer)
*   Git for cloning the repository

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/llamasearchai/OpenWorld.git
    cd OpenWorld
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (highly recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
    ```
    *We recommend naming your virtual environment `.venv` as it\'s a common standard and often recognized by IDEs.*

3.  **Install dependencies using Poetry (recommended for development):**
    OpenWorld uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and packaging.
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    poetry install --all-extras  # Install main dependencies and all optional groups
    ```
    Alternatively, if you prefer to use `pip` with `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # For development, install in editable mode:
    pip install -e .
    ```

### Running the API Server

To start the OpenWorld API server:
```bash
python -m src.openworld.api.server # Adjust if your entry point is different
# or if you set up a poetry script:
# poetry run start-api
```
The API will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for the interactive Swagger UI.

### Using the CLI

The OpenWorld CLI provides a convenient way to interact with the platform:
```bash
poetry run openworld-cli --help
poetry run openworld-cli physics-create --help
# ... and other commands
```
If not using Poetry, you might need to ensure the package is in your PYTHONPATH or call it via `python -m openworld.cli.main`.

## 🧪 Showcase & Examples

Explore practical examples and Jupyter notebooks in the `examples/` directory to see OpenWorld in action:

*   `examples/scripts/`: Contains standalone scripts demonstrating specific features.
